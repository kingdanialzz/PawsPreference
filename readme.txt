Hi and good day all! I'm Raja Muhammad Danial Raja Bidin and this is a fun web applications that can be run on multi-platform!

Paws & Preferences is an interactive web app where users swipe through adorable cat images, 
liking or disliking each one. Liked cats are displayed in a dynamic, animated gallery with hover effects, 
while floating cat emojis animate in the background to add a playful, lively feel. 
The app also includes sound effects for likes (cute_cat.mp3) and dislikes (angry_cat.mp3), 
as well as optional looping background music (cute_back.mp3) for an immersive experience. 
Sticky summary titles and text ensure your favorite cats are always visible while scrolling, 
and the design is fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

I built this project purposefully as a technical task for Netizen Experience, 
to test and demonstrate UX/UI skills, particularly in interactive design, responsive layouts, and engaging user experiences. 
At the same time, I took this opportunity to push my creativity, improve my front-end development skills, 
and explore animations, interactive hover effects, and audio integration.

This project showcases both a user-friendly interface and my eagerness to learn and experiment with new front-end techniques, 
combining fun, playful design with functional, responsive code.
